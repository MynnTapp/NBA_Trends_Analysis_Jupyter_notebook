# NBA Trends Analysis

This project explores trends and relationships in NBA game data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis covers team performance, game location effects, win probabilities, and point differentials, providing insights into factors that influence game outcomes.

## Project Overview
- Compare scoring performance between teams (e.g., Knicks vs. Nets)
- Analyze differences in points scored across seasons (2010 vs. 2014)
- Investigate the impact of home vs. away games on win rates
- Examine associations between forecasted win probabilities and actual point differentials

## Data Sources
- NBA game data sourced from FiveThirtyEight and Basketball Reference
- Includes variables such as team, points scored, game location, win/loss result, and forecasted win probability

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
	```bash
	pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn
	```
3. Open `activate_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Follow the step-by-step analysis in the notebook

## Notebooks
- `activate_notebook.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook

## Key Findings
- Team identity and game location are associated with points scored and game outcomes
- Home teams tend to win more often than away teams
- Forecasted win probabilities show a modest association with actual point differentials
